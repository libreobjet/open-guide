(Given  such meaning, the word property is   uncountable,  and as  such, is not  described with an indefinite  article  or as plural.)   Depending on the  nature of the property, an  owner of  property has the  right to consume,  **alter**, **share**,  **redefine**, rent, mortgage,  pawn, sell,  exchange, transfer, give   away or destroy it, or to exclude  others from  doing these things, as   well as to perhaps abandon it;  whereas regardless  of the nature of  the  property, the owner thereof has  the right to  properly use it (as  a  durable, mean or factor, or  whatever), or at the  very least   exclusively keep it.
