Proposition
========

How could we talk about something if we don't agree on the definitions behind the words we are using. We saw the urge to define a certain number of terms here and in the glossary so that, at least in the scope of this publication, you know what they represent for us. 

As product designers coming from the free/libre and open source software movement, we also are very picky with some words that have been defined in software field, especially the terms "open source", which we invariably link to "free / libre", although that's maybe not the case for everyone.

This book is trying to define "Open Source Product Design" so we are not going to define this extensively here − you willl have to read the whole book. But you may have already encountered similar terms as "Open design", "Open making", "Open source design" and so on. These overlap each other and sometimes set themselves apart. One might think these little differences are not important, because the overall idea is shared. We do not agree with this. It's in the little differences, in the terms and expression we use that lies the ideals we stand for. 

#### Product design
>  As a verb is the process of creating a new product to be sold by a  business to its customers. A very broad concept, it is  essentially the  efficient and effective  generation and development of  ideas through a  process that leads to new  products.

#### Open making
Open making is a practice mainly defined by the community  around the website and project called OpenDesk. 
>  [They seek] to define  an emerging movement at the intersection of  technology, design  and  manufacturing. [Open design] is an evolving set  of principles and best   practices on design and production for a  collaborative economy.

#### Open design
>  Open design is the development of physical products, machines and  systems through  use of publicly shared design information. Open design   involves the  making of both free and open-source software (FOSS) as well as open-source hardware. The process is generally facilitated by the Internet and often  performed without monetary compensation. The goals  and philosophy are identical to that of the open-source  movement, but are implemented for the development of physical products  rather than  software.[5] Open design is a form of co-creation, where  the final  product is designed by the users, rather than an external  stakeholder  such as a private company.

#### Open source design
>  Open  source design is a term coined mostly by the  graphic design community.  This thus embraces a practice more related to the study of graphical  user interfaces for software than its physical  counter part. Maybe this all due to the fact that "design" is such a broad term that applies to  any action that involves making decisions or "planning something". http://opensourcedesign.net/ 

At each chapter of the book, to understand and illustrate what we are speaking about.
We will approach those points : tools, objects, references and open questions.

Tools
-------

- [Wikipedia](http://wikipedia ) is a collaborative user-edited encyclopedia. It is fantastic tool for an ever evloving consensus on definitions.

Objects
-----------
Here we will give some example of project to illustrate the meaning...

References
----------------
- [Open Making Manifesto](https://openmaking.is/ )

Open questions
----------------------
 - Are you satisfied with the terms "Open Source Product Design"?
 - Are you "free/libre" or "open source"?
 - Do you think we should agree on a definition?
